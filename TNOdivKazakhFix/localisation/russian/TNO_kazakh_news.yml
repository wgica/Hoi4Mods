 WORLD.1100.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Communists Reunify Kazakhstan!"
 WORLD.1100.desc: "Kazakhstan, once divided, is reunited again under the banner of hammer and sickle. General secretary and military leader of the Soviet remnants in Kyzylorda, Bauyrzhan Momyshuly, announced the end of armed hostilities within Kazakhstan and proclaimed the ultimate defeat over the reactionaries that resisted the workers' regime in the Kazakh SSR.\n\nThe future of the reborn socialist state remains unclear. Although previously Kazakh SSR was subordinate to the central Soviet authority in Moscow, the separated republic now finds itself in a situation where the state they were loyal to no longer exists, and many argue that Kazakhstan itself should become the center of a new Soviet Union. No matter what fate holds, no one can doubt that the Soviet power will persist in Kazakhstan for a long time.\n"
 WORLD.1100.a: "Meet the old boss."

 WORLD.1101.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Bandits Reign in Kazakhstan!"
 WORLD.1101.desc: "If there remained any hope for an end of chaos and for restoration of order in Kazakhstan, it doesn't exist now. The bandit armies under the leadership of boastful and ruthless Abu Khan of Kokshetau trampled the remaining areas of authority under the hooves of steppe horses and now reign over the vast territories of Kazakhstan untamed. The helpless Kazakh population now has to rely only on themselves for protection from regular raids into cities and the countryside.\n\nPleased with his most glorious victories, Abu Khan, however, doesn't want to stop on his laurels. Realizing that they can become the next target for the marauder hordes of Kazakhstan, the states in Southern Russia and Central Asia became more watchful at their borders in hopes to spare themselves from the wrath of Khan.\n"
 WORLD.1101.a: "The khan rises."

 WORLD.1102.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Liberals Reunify Kazakhstan!"
 WORLD.1102.desc: "Previously restrained by the will of despots, the Kazakh phoenix rises anew as a beacon of liberty and democracy in the steppes. First President of the Republic of Kazakhstan, Sabit Mukanov, in the appeal to the country congratulated his fellow citizens with a victory over tyranny and ignorance and proclaimed the final reunification of the Kazakh nation under a democratic rule, envisioning a prosperous future for the homeland after the long years of bitter infighting and senseless bloodshed.\n\nA lamb amongst a pack of wolves, the newly-founded republic announced its desire for international recognition and cooperation with the democratic powers. The time will tell if Kazakhstan can break away from its prolonged isolation.\n"
 WORLD.1102.a: "It seems that sometimes peace and freedom survive in this world."

 WORLD.1103.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Pragmatists Reunify Kazakhstan!"
 WORLD.1103.desc: "In wild nature, the fittest comes at the top. The state of Aktobe, which adopted flexibility and pragmatism as its main tenets, emerged victorious in a warring Kazakhstan and left behind its numerous rivals. President, Chairman and the Father of Nation Nikolay Onoprienko now reigns as an indisputable authoritarian ruler of the national republic, heading the country towards his unique vision of never-ending and severe progress.\n\nA black mark on the map since the Soviet downfall, Kazakhstan now tries to reach out the major powers in the region, hoping to achieve its place under the sun. Although it is unclear what can the young and underdeveloped Central Asian nation offer to the world, Onoprienko puts his greatest hopes that independent Kazakhstan will become a mediator between world powers in its own right.\n"
 WORLD.1103.a: "What can backwater Kazakhstan even do for the world?"

 WORLD.1104.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Fascists Reunify Kazakhstan!"
 WORLD.1104.desc: "The darkness shines over the Kazakh lands. The extremely xenophobic and nationalistic state in Aktau, once demeaned by their rivals as an insignificant, if fearsome, contender, have exterminated every opposing force in their struggle for power in Kazakhstan. To commemorate the final victory over the last remnants of resistance, massive celebrations in honor of Supreme Leader Safa Gaziz were held across the country. Waves of Slavic refugees, as well as Gaziz's political opponents, are attempting to escape Kazakhstan to avoid the fate of their less fortunate countrymen who were caught by the Blueshirts.\n\nHaving accomplishing his messianic quest as the father of a purified Kazakh state, Gaziz doesn't think his mission has come to an end. Strongly believing in the righteousness of the Nazi doctrine, the Kesem of Kazakhstan turned his eyes on the Reich, wishing to accompany the Reich's civilizing mission against the Slavic threat.\n"
 WORLD.1104.a: "Nazis? In Kazakhstan? Don't make things up!"

 WORLD.1105.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]The Poles Pacify Kazakhstan!"
 WORLD.1105.desc: "News from the Kazakh steppes rarely reaches international observers, and those that do usually leave more questions than answers. The state of 'Nowa Polska', a former Soviet autonomous republic and the current refuge for Polish exiles fom the Reich, has established full military control over Kazakhstan in attempts to repel the aggression into their new homeland.\n\nTo assure its security, the Polish government took measures to establish a friendly Kazakh republic and set up a buffer zone in Aktobe between the two nations. While the peace in Central Asia has been achieved after years of warlord warfare, the prospects of the Polish-dominated Kazakhstan are yet to be seen.\n"
 WORLD.1105.a: "A Polish Kazakhstan? Truly, we live in exceptional times!"

 WORLD.1106.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Fundamentalists Reunify Kazakhstan!"
 WORLD.1106.desc: "The Kazakh people, left without spiritual guidance after the Soviet collapse, now seek refuge with Allah, the Lord of Mankind. Nikolay Zabelkin of Kostanay, a warlord turned a pious man, achieved his victory over the secular sovereigns of Kazakhstan and expanded his Islamic fundamentalist rule over the whole country. A land of anarchy before, Kazakhstan is now a territory governed not by artificial human rules, but by the laws sent by God himself.\n\nThe Islamic Republic of Kazakhstan shows little concern with the affairs of the sinful earth and have decided to turn themselves to isolationism, away from the temptations of the foreign world. The gates of Kazakhstan, once unguarded, are now closed to non-believers.\n"
 WORLD.1106.a: "From unholy nightmare to holy kingdom."
