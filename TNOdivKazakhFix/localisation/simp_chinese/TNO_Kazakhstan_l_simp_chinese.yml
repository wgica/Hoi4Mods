 POLITICS_BAURYZHAN_MOMYSHULY_DESC: "General Bauyrzhan Momyshuly is a hero of both the Soviet Union and Kazakhstan and he will always be loyal to his two homelands. He hails from a humble background and worked various state jobs in Kazkahstan before being conscripted and eventually would lead multiple division in the war. Some have called Momyshuly an anti-Soviet Kazakh nationalist due to his love of Alash Orda poetry, a few even calling for his removal from the Soviet armed forces completely. His loyalities would be tested with the German invasion. Not only were his loyalties to the Soviet Union confirmed, but so was his loyalty to Leninist doctrine itself.\n\nWhen the war ended, Momyshuly quickly reorganized the forces and commanders that remained and reestablished the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic. He now controls the most land and wields the strongest army in Kazakhstan. In his mind, the Soviet Union and communism has only been temporarily destroyed and is just waiting for a catalyst to revive it. He is determined to be that catalyst."

 POLITICS_DINMUKHAMED_KUNAEV_DESC: "丁穆罕默德·库纳耶夫不仅继承了哈萨克共产党第一书记之位，也继承了一个奇迹。沙亚赫梅托夫书记领导哈萨克斯坦的十年绝不平凡，历经两场灾难，哈萨克斯坦仿佛本应灭亡。沙亚赫梅托夫重病缠身，让孤立的哈萨克斯坦在下一个十年中更上一层楼的重担就落到了库纳耶夫身上。库纳耶夫相信，自己已经准备好应对挑战。\n\n然而，虽然哈萨克斯坦延续了下来，但是过去的伤痕并没有愈合，新的创口也还在不断出现。多年的忽视与破坏，令哈萨克族在自己的祖国里，人数都只能勉强过半。在北方，无穷无尽的难民与土匪蜂拥而下，要让天平更加倾斜。即便是当下，斯大林和布哈林留下的遗产也依然死而不僵。倘若哈萨克斯坦企图偏离他们的道路，那代表他们的势力就会出面干涉。\n\n目前为止，库纳耶夫在自己的道路上，走得还算顺利——哈萨克斯坦确实正逐渐脱离前书记的道路。库纳耶夫一直支持哈萨克族自己的产业与文化，他的政策不仅把哈萨克公民的地位放在俄罗斯流亡者之上，也在沙亚赫梅托夫的基础上更进一步促进地方工业的发展。\n\n不过，这条路线的反对者可谓多如牛毛。从菲京，到尤苏波夫，甚至沙亚赫梅托夫本人，也在反对者之列。不少人对库纳耶夫的做法忧虑不安，他们认为，破坏俄罗斯族和哈萨克族之间的平衡必将引发灾难。库纳耶夫则相信，十年后的哈萨克斯坦，定会是前所未有的强大自主。或许，世界不会同意他的观点。"
 POLITICS_ISMAIL_YUSUPOV_DESC: "随着哈萨克斯坦的民族分裂与不稳定局势越来越严重，伊斯梅尔·尤苏波夫越来越被他“不是什么”，而不是他“是什么”所定义。他是维吾尔人、也是一位战争英雄、更是一名老谋深算的官僚，但重要的是，他不是哈萨克人，也不是俄罗斯人。\n\n在担任卡拉干达党委书记多年后，很少有人能料到尤苏波夫会随着库纳耶夫的倒台而掌权。尤苏波夫是一个地位不算低也不算高的阴谋家，希望自己能担任一个更加重要的职位，但仅此而已。然而，当菲京和沙亚赫梅托夫都无缘坐上第一书记宝座时，他们便开始寻找一个手中没有过多权力资源的折中人物。至于他们选择了谁，事实已经不言自明了。\n\n这次升迁并不光彩，尤苏波夫有许多强大的“盟友”，而他必须保护他们的利益。但要是尤苏波夫真的想让自己活下来，就必须解决一个更大的问题：独立问题不能再被忽视，两民族间为争夺其结果的冲突每天都在更加公开地进行。他必须做出选择，但无论何种选择，这个国家都难逃毁灭。\n\n所以尤苏波夫没有选择。他的计划旨在通过工农业发展项目撮合两个民族，全然不顾他的靠山提出怎样沙文主义的要求。如果“处女地运动”取得成功，他可能会不耗一枪一弹地结束这场危机。但如果失败，矛盾与冲突只会愈演愈烈，而尤苏波夫、哈萨克人与俄罗斯人，乃至所有人都无法幸免于难。"
 KAZ_Pavel_Fitin: "帕维尔·菲京"
 POLITICS_PAVEL_FITIN_DESC: "在他于哈萨克斯坦任职的辉煌职业生涯期间，菲京一直认为这片土地不仅是一个国家，还是一座堡垒。苏维埃联盟在俄罗斯的土地上崩坏瓦解，为人唾弃，在哈萨克斯坦却得以幸存，成为各民族之间牢不可破的纽带。当库纳耶夫试图破坏这一纽带时，菲京做了他不得不做的事。\n\n很快，帕维尔·菲京象征性地把一些哈萨克人提拔到了高层，并试图安抚公众，让他们相信稳定和安全很快就会回到哈萨克苏维埃社会主义共和国。对于俄罗斯人和其他流亡者来说，这是一个值得庆祝的时刻，因为这意味着辉煌的苏维埃联盟可能很快就会归来。\n\n但他已经意识到，自己的谋划出了些微妙的失误。哈萨克人并不为这一前景感到兴奋，他们走上街头，对自己的代表被流放或失踪感到愤怒。就在他试图理解这种愤怒的时候，来自他背后的声音则告诉他俄罗斯族的盟友很高兴看到这样一个由他们统治的世界。\n\n帕维尔·菲京本是一个俄罗斯人。正是这无可改变的血统给他带来了无尽的挫败感，意味着他的苏维埃理想与政治现实之间存在着确凿的矛盾。然而，这也是他的政府，以及政府的计划、领导与言辞的真实写照。他身边的哈萨克人和俄罗斯人都在问同样的问题：“谁会先撑不住？”"
 KAZ_Stanislaw_Skrzeszewski: "斯坦尼斯瓦夫·斯克热谢夫斯基"
 POLITICS_STANISLAW_SKRZESZEWSKI_DESC: "1939年，斯坦尼斯瓦夫·斯克热谢夫斯基眼睁睁地看着自己的祖国在民族主义的火焰与大规模的强制灭绝政策下燃烧、撕裂、腐烂。他率领着自己麾下的一小撮共产主义骨干和一大批难民，离开波兰东部，最终来到了哈萨克斯坦。随着时间的推移，他们完全失去了回乡的希望。哈萨克斯坦成了他们的新家，波兰人民最后的避难所。\n\n现在，时间来到了六十年代中期，他们的新家似乎也濒临崩溃，遭受同样可怕的命运。\n\n斯克热谢夫斯基本来不应是哈萨克斯坦的领袖。他是一个少数民族社区的领导人，也担任着一个重要的经济职位，但对这个国家来说，他并不是什么重要的政治人物。他被选中仅仅是因为他是少数民族，而哈萨克斯坦紧张的民族局势让哈萨克人和俄罗斯人无法达成共识。他的上台只是一个权宜之计，假以时日，哈萨克斯坦必定会碾碎他。"
 KAZ_Zhumabek_Tashenev: "茹马别克·塔舍涅夫"
 POLITICS_ZHUMABEK_TASHENEV_DESC: "自斯大林时代以来，哈萨克人民正一步步走向独立。阿拉木图等大城市的新一代思想家认为，他们并非是在延续苏联的意识形态，而是一种独特的哈萨克思想，一种让哈萨克军队能够在俄罗斯的大部分地区都陷入分裂的危难时局下保护中亚的一系列价值观。茹马别克·塔舍涅夫曾经只是众多此类思想家的一员，现在却领导着这个国家。\n\n从一开始出版一系列作品，到后来担任丁穆罕默德·库纳耶夫的副手，塔舍涅夫一直宣扬哈萨克斯坦的社会主义愿景，并在很大程度上摆脱了苏联的影响，理由很简单：苏联已经不复存在。他认为，不对国家进行重组和再开发是对俄族人的一种让步，只要哈萨克斯坦不完全摆脱对俄罗斯农产品的依赖，俄罗斯人就仍会把哈萨克斯坦当成他们的殖民地。\n\n随着内战愈演愈烈，他开始担心自己是对的。"
 POLITICS_SAGADAT_NURMAGAMBETOV_DESC: "时局艰难时，合格的爱国者必须时刻准备好以任何必要的手段夺取控制权。萨加达特·科扎赫梅托维奇·努尔马甘别托夫明白这一点，他正在为捍卫哈萨克这个民族概念而战。\n\n努尔马甘别托夫在伟大的卫国战争中表现出色，这为他在哈萨克人民中间赢得了战争英雄的美誉。即便他的同僚莫穆什吾勒惨遭清洗，努尔马甘别托夫仍继续在军队中光荣地服役，并在西俄战争期间再次证明了自己。\n\n作为库纳耶夫及其民族主义说辞的崇拜者，努尔马甘别托夫成为了哈萨克武装部队在政府中最具权势的代表之一。这使他在苏维埃派掌权后成为菲京的眼中钉，并导致他的军旅职业生涯随着菲京试图驱逐一切潜在的敌人而逐渐走向尽头。\n\n努尔马甘别托夫对哈萨克斯坦再次成为俄罗斯附庸的未来感到恐惧，叛变是他唯一阻止它成为事实的办法。现在，他率领着爱国者的队伍为独立而战，为哈萨克斯坦这艘船舶摆脱俄罗斯这只船锚而战。"

The territory of Kyzylorda, while encompassing a third of Kazakhstan, has authority over a much less. Bandits have taken power in many areas and have become rich off raiding. This has to end. General Secretary Momyshuly has a plan to deal with these "bandit kings" that has been years in the making. They may not know it, but these are the last days of banditry in Kazakhstan."
 KAZ_set_the_trap: "Set The Trap"
 KAZ_set_the_trap_desc: "A swift decapitation of the bandit leadership is a key component for dealing with this threat. For this operation we need to lure in the leadership of the various clans and petty "kingdoms" placate each one, and finally kill them all. While many potential execution methods have been proposed, the one decided on is to use German bombing campaigns to our advantage. Use radio static to get bombers near our preffered to location, and lure in the bandit leaders. Those outlaws are survivors, but few leave them a barrage of bombs alive."
 KAZ_whisper_campaign: "Whisper Campaign"
 KAZ_whisper_campaign_desc: "Distrust is a potent weapon of war. Destroying the leadership can only do so much, for others will rise to the occasion.

 KAZ_add_treats: "Add The Bait"
 KAZ_add_treats_desc: "Bait will be needed to attract the bandits to the trap, by leaving a small amount of military equipment we will be able to ensure as many bandits as possible are brought to the trap, making the bombing attack all the more successful. While this will hurt our military in the short run it will be a bonus in the long run for the damage done."

 KAZ_prepare_the_convoy: "Prepare The Convoy"
 KAZ_prepare_the_convoy_desc: "To efficiently dump the bandit into the various regions outside our state we must prepare a mechanized convoy to transport the troops without being bombed by the Germans.

 KAZ_not_our_problem: "Not Our Problem"
 KAZ_not_our_problem_desc: "With the convoy complete and ready to move we shall begin the process of dumping the bandit scum in the neighbouring regions.

 KAZ_all_quiet_desc: "With all the fighting done and the bandit question dealt with, a sense of calm and quiet has descended over our territories as people experience peace for the first time in years. Other than the occasional German bombing raids that have become more infrequent as days pass, peace reigns in our territories. However conflict is arising in the region and this peace and quiet will only be the calm before the storm, it's time for the Four year plan to begin."
 KAZ_four_year_plan: "Four Year Plan"
 KAZ_four_year_plan_desc: "For the last twenty years, our republic has prevailed against all odds, survived in spite of all the woes inflicted on the Soviet people. Even though our beloved Union fell to the Germans and the various reactionary elements established their foothold in most of areas of Kazakhstan, using our temporal weakness to their advantage, the resolve of the Soviet Kazakh people, the Kazakh Red Army and the Communist Party remained unbreakable. But even if the Marxist ideals proved itself to be stronger than the Fascist bombs, such situation can't continue any longer when the enemies of the people grow stronger with every day; our further idleness will only serve as our end.\n\nIn his speech towards fellow generals and party workers, General Momyshuly proclaimed the beginning of the Four Year Plan, which will entail the reconstruction of the national economy and preparation for our future confrontations against the rebellious gangs across the country, reuniting the Kazakh SSR once and for all.\n\nThe Mother History has not left us more time to spare. Either we will overcome our enemies in four years or they will crush us."
 KAZ_reconstruct_roads: "Reconstruct The Roads"
 KAZ_reconstruct_roads_desc: "Buildings roads is a long, unglamorous work. But someone has to do it.\n\nThis work is especially critical around the dusty expanses of south eastern Kazakhstan. Supply convoys, civilian trade and contacts with others Central Asia all require good transport infrastructure. This also extend to refueling station, as well as oasis and rest spots on the most popular caravan routes through the desert. The nomadic tribes are an understated yet important part of our transport economy, and accommodating them better is a cheap way to earn their love."
 KAZ_reopen_steel: "Reopen Steel Mills"
 KAZ_reopen_steel_desc: "In its last moments of life, the Soviet Union evacuated many of its Russian facilities to the Kazakh SSR so they would not be taken by the Fascists and will serve another day even if Moscow falls to the enemy. Even though many of those factories were seized by reactionaries or were bombed by the Fascist planes, those steelworks we still own will be the greatest asset for our developing program.\n\nThe Kazakh Soviet government will provide all necessary help and equipment to the national steel mills to restart their performance and increase their productivity, allowing us to reach and even exceed the pre-war industrial levels and pronounce our superiority in arms against our enemies."
 KAZ_open_soviet_supplies: "Crack Open Soviet Supplies"
 KAZ_open_soviet_supplies_desc: "The Soviet Union did its best to prepare for the upcoming war with the German menace. Its failure still left a legacy of buried supply caches, relocated resources and looted German arms hidden beyond their reach.\n\nSome of the weapon cornucopia was used up during the West Russian War. But the collapse of the united front has sent our army back to Kazakhstan. Since then, our domestic manufacturing and foreign imports have kept most of our supplies topped up, making the use of Soviet era caches redundant.\n\nNow that the bombing campaign has ended, and that war is again on the horizon, it might be a good time to dig up everything that is left over. A bureaucratic effort will let us cross-tabulate every stash's location, and the best way to allocate resources. Some of this old equipment will go to reserve units to free up the best stuff for front line troops. Critical industrial tools will be used to replenish our stocks and help with the industrialization campaign. We must make use of the previous generation's work!"
 KAZ_scouting_missions: "Scouting Missions"
 KAZ_scouting_missions_desc: "Soviet supply caches and industry moved in from Western Russia have proven extremely useful so far on our mission to restore the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic. We may soon reach a point of diminishing returns where everything that could be reused has already been secured. For now, however, there remains untapped sources of equipment out there.\n\nIn the collapse of the Soviet Union, and then the failure of the WRRF's war, many Soviet installations have been abandoned. Meteorological stations, distant military outposts, radar stations and most important of all, energy installations.\n\nAny power plant, oil field or coal deposit established during the Bukharin era must be made available for the Kyzil Orda. The industry and vehicles needed to push back the reactionaries will not move by themselves, and so it is crucial for us to reclaim any source of power we can use. Any installation found along the way will be turned to good use."

 KAZ_prepare_for_war_desc: "Though a small part of the Revolutionary Army during both the Great Patriotic and West Russian Wars, the Central Asian Red Army proved itself a capable force, bloodying even the most ferocious of the German SS. The wars, though they ended in defeat for the Union, had imparted to it valuable lessons and experience. In the meantime, however, various warlords have laid their claims upon Kazakhstan, taking advantage of its absence.\n\nNow that the terror bombing has ended, its officers have begun preparing for the army for its eventual role as a force to reunify Kazakhstan. Drills and recruitment will have to be restarted, along with the research and production of new equipment. Our troops might be the best-equipped and trained in Kazakhstan, but that is not a reason to be complacent. Peace may be possible yet, but we must plan for war."
 KAZ_dam_the_rivers: "Dam The Rivers"
 KAZ_dam_the_rivers_desc: "The rivers of Ili and Charyn have lain in Kazakhstan for centuries, feeding its people, and letting civilization flourish by its banks. Now, in these times, they must lend one final aid, for us to again rise from the ashes, not only to survive, but also to thrive. That they once provided us with the necessities is no longer enough; fortunately, we have a way to utilize the rivers further.\n\nOur engineers and architects have drawn up plans for a hydroelectric dam. Their streams will flow to the turbines, finally providing us with the means to electrify our region in general and our factories in particular, on a scale not seen from after the Fall of the Union.\n\nWith those dams in place, we can open new fisheries in the region, using the now-heightened currents as a base and grounds for them. We can also channel the rivers into irrigation, providing us with the means to restart cotton farming and production, and thus clothe our people for Kazakhstan's hot summers and cold nights."

 KAZ_comrade_cotton_desc: "With dams operational and the fisheries opened, now it is time to turn our attention toward cultivating cotton, a crop that suits Kazakhstani climate well. The plant is particularly useful to spin into absorbent, versatile fabrics of varying thickness. In the cold desert climate of our lands, cotton-made clothing is popular but scarce.\n\nWith the new dams channeling the river into irrigation ditches scattered all over our territory, we can now consider reviving the mass cultivation of the crop. We will envelop the banks in white and clad Kazakhstan and its people likewise. The flexible fabric will let us work for longer, and better. The varying thickness can be adjusted for either the hot summer days or cold nights.\n\nThere are others that live in Kazakhstan other than ourselves. These will also desire to gain access to the revered Comrade Cotton. Through trade, we can increase the administration's budget, and therefore be one step closer to reunifying Kazakhstan under a legitimate authority of the union."
 KAZ_coal_production: "Coal Production"
 KAZ_coal_production_desc: "After the union retreated from Kazakhstan and various warlords laid their claims on it, coal mining was relegated to a secondary role, as it's market value plummeted in the wake of the chaos that ensued. Then the German bombers came, and after that, there was no more use for coal other than warming and small-scale industry. The coal mines that once dug deep into the bowels of the earth are now quiet, abandoned.\n\nNow that the Germans have withdrawn, reindustrialization is now a viable option for the administration to take. But first, we have to seek ways to re-power our factories and machinery. The coal mines are indispensable in this goal. By sending miners to their depths again, we can ensure that coke flows out afresh, providing us a stable base to re-electrify the region.\n\nThe coal thus secure, we can look toward trading surpluses with our Kirghiz brothers for raw materials to process. After that, who knows? Maybe one day we will have the Kazakh giant awaken again as a bulwark of the union."
 KAZ_trade_with_krygz: "Trade with Kirghizia"
 KAZ_trade_with_krygz_desc: "Kirghizia has been a country with dubious allegiance ever since it ceased to respond to the calls of Kyzylorda and other socialist countries, but they always seemed to be at least somewhat willing to keep cordial relationship with us, if not merely for their own gains. However, our current situation doesn't present us with an opportunity to be too demanding to our unfortunate partners.\n\nThe diplomatic agents of Kirghizia arrived to our capital with an offer to provide the Kazakh SSR with a substantial amount of their abundant resources in exchange for our surplus arms. While we are not exactly sure for what purpose they intend to use our weapons, their resources would be very beneficial for us to make this deal worthy."
 KAZ_rebuild_factories: "Rebuild Factories"
 KAZ_rebuild_factories_desc: "After the fall of the Union and the coming of the Germans through the skies, workers abandoned the factories, as these were primary targets of the terror bombing. What remained after the Germans' ruinous rampage were swiftly gathering dust; the government could not organize labor amid shrapnel, and the workers were unwilling to risk the travel. Compounded with issues regarding raw materials and energy, the reindustrialization of Kazakhstan seemed a faraway prospect.\n\nThat has changed. With both coal and a steady supply of raw materials, we can now proceed to the final step of rebuilding our industry: reorganization of labor and reopening of our remaining factories, as well as the salvage of heavy industrial equipment lying within ruined ones. A new union awaits, somewhere on the horizon, and Kazakhstan shall join it, with our heads held high."
 KAZ_help_the_farmers: "Help The Farmers"
 KAZ_help_the_farmers_desc: "For twenty years of ruinous warfare, the Soviet farmers were left with nothing but empty hands. They lost their houses to bombings and warfare, they lost their crops to bandits and they gave their last remaining tools for food and money to survive. Every day they wander long distances to nearby cities and other villages to sell their belongings in exchange for supplies and leave themselves open to predatory paws of speculators who profit on their misery. To neglect help to the Soviet agriculture means only to doom our whole farmer class to a certain death.\n\nThe calls for the help of a Soviet countryman will not be left unheard by the ears of the Party. With our financial support, we will help them to rebuild their houses and will give them every necessary asset so their hard work will flourish for the common good once again."
 KAZ_temporary_rationing: "Temporary Rationing"
 KAZ_temporary_rationing_desc: "The aid granted to the farmers has begun to pay off. Food production throughout our territory is increasing, and famines, though they still occur, have declined. Several issues remain, however. The agricultural distributions are concentrated around farms, leaving the periphery of our territories often unaffected by the aid. Further from the border, an epidemic of hoarding has left some of the population without access to foodstuffs.\n\nIn order to change this, the economic planners have proposed a system of rationing, similar to that in force during the Great Patriotic War. Doing this will allow us to spread the farm produces more equally, reducing the risk of any further famines, and curtailing inequality along the way. Though it may seem odd to implement such a constraint when there is no war, hunger is an enemy to every one of us. Fighting it shall be a duty borne by all citizens."
 KAZ_centralize_sheep: "Centralize The Sheep Herders"
 KAZ_centralize_sheep_desc: "Kazakhstan is a land of contrasts. Outside the cities, where masses of people live, work, and sleep, lay the vast, empty plains of the Kazakh steppe. There, the sheepherders guide their herds from one grazing ground to another, living like their ancestors, a relic predating the Union and Empire. The Germans did not even seem to bother them. Their fat-tailed sheep provide the luxury of the Kazakhs: milk, wool, and mutton.\n\nOur Soviet planners have worked out the plans to integrate them into our economy. The government will firstly establish a renegotiable price for the wool, allowing us to spin it into coats, mittens, and headwear. Next, we will map out, highlight, and protect grazing areas and the routes into them, ensuring a steady supply. Even if they don't realize it, the herders are comrades; and with these efforts, perhaps one day, they will embrace socialism themselves."
 KAZ_collectivisation: "Collectivisation"
 KAZ_collectivisation_desc: "In the chaos of the years after the West Russian War, Kazakhstani planned economy vanished. In its place, capitalism and private businesses grew, replacing the ideal system that socialism envisioned. The workers, laborers, and farmers found themselves again under the yoke they had cast off long ago. The administration has, until recently, taken a pragmatic approach regarding this. It was a choice between that or having no economy at all.\n\nThe government hasn't been idle, however. In the intervening years between the cessation of the German terror bombing and the present time, it has rebuilt its centralized economy. Now, without the utter need for survival, it is time to be rid of these parasitic and exploitative elements of the human condition. We shall buy or force them out. They will remain footnotes, left behind in the dust of the enduring march for socialism and equality."

 KAZ_reopen_air_bases_desc: "At the onset of the German bombings, the Central Asian Air and Air Defense Armies scrambled to intercept the terror bombers that flew over Kazakhstan. It was successful for a while. However, as the bombings intensified, with the Germans sending more and more planes, the Air Force began losing fighters, parts, and fuel. These resources were irreplaceable, as the bombings had made their production impossible. The high command ordered all interception missions canceled, and all planes hidden.\n\nWith the halt of German activity in the sky, and a subsequent revival in some of our industrial capacity, an air force is feasible again. The administration has agreed to reopen the hangars and airbases, along with the resumption of air drills and pilot training. These efforts are necessary to maintain an edge over the warlords, and, eventually, in the reunification."
 KAZ_repair_planes: "Repair Planes"
 KAZ_repair_planes_desc: "During the reopening and rebuilding of airbases and hangars that once belonged to the Central Asian Air Army, the high command was horrified to discover that the bombing had caused many of it to collapse, burying planes inside. Whatever was left intact had degraded in the meantime, rusting with no replaceable parts available. There is a severe discrepancy in the numbers we expected to recover and its actual figure.\n\nTo alleviate this difficulty, the administration will dispatch mechanics and technicians to assess the damage and repair them. Workers will be tasked to lift the rubble and salvage whatever parts they can find. Though the planes are old, with the newest ones dating to the '50s, they are still useful in denying the enemy air superiority. Perhaps, at a later date, we can devise new inventions of our own, and let socialism dominate the skies."

 KAZ_helicopter_designs_desc: "Many things have changed in the outside world since the end of the West Russian War. One of these, chiefly within our military interests, is the helicopter. This aircraft, utilizing rotors for lift and thrust, has seen use by the Russians, but not in Kazakhstan itself. A technological marvel, capable of performing tasks fixed-wing aircraft cannot: troop transport without airfields, direct fire support, and better aerial reconnaissance, its value is clear to the high command.\n\nIn order to produce these for ourselves; we have gathered engineers and technicians, as well as economic planners, to come up with a design adapted to our native production methods. This will put our scientific and industrial capabilities to the test, as helicopters are complicated vehicles. However, succeeding and producing even a few will be a triumph for socialism, and aid for the wars to come."

Beyond the borders of Russia, both to its East and West, and across oceans and straits, the art of conducting war remains a fluid art, continually evolving to suit the demands of time. As humanity conflicts with itself, the world requires the soldier to be better, stronger, faster, and more numerous than ever before. With the growing number of weapons and equipment he must master, all nations rush to create training methods more universal and accessible to their citizens.\n\nAlthough we lost the Great Patriotic War and the West Russian War after it, the experience gleaned from the bloody battles against the Germans and the traitors has given us clues as to what constitutes the perfect soldier. Using this knowledge, we can reform and improve our training methods, so that when war comes, it shall not find us wanting."

 KAZ_gifts_of_the_past_desc: "During the immediate commencement of the German terror bombing campaign and the subsequent failure of the Air and Air Defense Armies to contain it, the Central Asian Military District decided to transport all their arms from stockpiles located throughout Kazakhstan, and into our capital, where they can be kept safe. Afraid of continued loss due to the Luftwaffe's growing number of bombers, the high command decided to hurry this evacuation. It left some storehouses practically untouched, with guns, ammunition, and explosives nestled inside them.\n\nWith the Germans out of the skies and our minds, we can look forward to reopening and salvaging these. Dusty, old, and outdated though the weapons may be, they can still be put to use in the service to Socialism. The warlords, illegitimate as they are, present a credible threat against us, but they will think twice to face soldiers armed by the last gift of the Union."

 KAZ_legacy_of_the_patriotic_war_desc: "For the Central Asian Military District, the Great Patriotic War was a time of revelation. It fought vigorously in that conflict, managing to score victories against the elite German SS divisions. Yet for all its achievements, the war exposed the weak, underdeveloped elements of the Soviet doctrine. It had practically fought using tactics taken straight from the Great War. Faced with an enemy with a crushing advantage in tactics and equipment, it won those battles by the skin of its teeth.\n\nTo remedy this shortcoming, we have to take a long and hard statistical approach towards analyzing data from the war. Our military scientists will be tasked to come up with critiques of the principal army doctrine and to suggest improvements in how to better utilize military equipment in different situations. With this tactical superiority over the warlords, it won't be too long until all of Kazakhstan is under Socialism again."
 KAZ_motorisation: "Motorisation"
 KAZ_motorisation_desc: "The Great Patriotic and West Russian Wars saw a prevalent usage of motorized vehicles for both sides. The Germans and the Soviets utilized these in the same manner as one another: to exploit openings in the battle line and to form fire brigades with which to plug them closed. As the wars wore on to the winter months, however, the Russian Rasputista stopped both armies in their tracks, as the puddles of the Soviet roads turned into death traps for trucks and tanks alike. The mud would cling to tires and tank tracks, pulling them down and requiring a lot of men to push them out.\n\nIn Kazakhstan's deserts and arid plains, however, the story is different. Fast exploitation tactics are viable all-year, and the lack of geographical impediment means that properly trained and equipped motorized divisions can rush the enemy, encircling and trapping them in pockets. The warlords must realize this to be the case as well, and how quickly we can train and arm these divisions will be a matter of life and death."
 KAZ_rusted_tanks: "Repair Rusted Tanks"
 KAZ_rusted_tanks_desc: "During the West Russian War, the military command of the Kazakh SSR, in its battles with, and eventual retreat from the German SS, realized the fatal potential of bombers against ground assets. These planes screamed alarm as they approached to deliver the payload: tank-busting bombs, pillbox-shattering explosives. When the German terror bombing campaign commenced in earnest, the high command was not keen on repeating their mistakes and ordered the tank fleet.\n\nThese armored vehicles, once the pride, joy, shield, and sword of the Union, now sit in warehouses and tank hangars, rusting away in atrophy and apathy. With the threat of war looming on the horizon, the administration and the high command has agreed to dispatch engineers and mechanics to repair and salvage whatever they can of the tank fleet. Paired with our motorized divisions, these will again be the Union's greatest asset."
 KAZ_new_designs: "New Designs"
 KAZ_new_designs_desc: "The needs of warfare are always ever-changing and evolving. Outside of the Union, where war continues apace without so much as a pause, a need arises for a vehicle that combines rapid troop transport and armored support. The Infantry Fighting Vehicle, evolving out of the three great powers, has fulfilled this niche. Better-armed than a regular Armored Personnel Carrier and much more mobile than a conventional tank, the IFV manages to combine the best of both worlds. Naturally, our high command has been wanting to get their hands on them.\n\nBy pooling together our scientific and engineering talent from across our territories, we can come up with a design that specifically addresses the terrain of Kazakhstan and the limitations of our industry. Once produced, these will be the teeth of our mechanized divisions, combining both speed and durability: a worthy product of socialism."
 KAZ_the_new_kazakhstan: "The New Kazakh Army"
 KAZ_the_new_kazakhstan_desc: "After seeing their performances on the West Russian and Great Patriotic Wars, no one can deny that the fame of the Central Asian Military District was well-earned. However, their success in the trials of the fifties masked shortcomings in doctrine, technology, and logistics. The veterans of those wars rank among the most renowned soldiers of all time, legendary in pulling miracle after miracle, snatching many victories from the jaws of defeat, a solitary light amid the dark.\n\nThey are no longer alone. Recruits, hardened by the new training methods and steeled with battle, now fill our ranks. The Air and Air Defence Armies have risen again, dominating the skies in the name of socialism. On the ground, our motorized and mechanized corps have no equal, tearing through the enemy lines like an arrow through the air. With these, the reunification is one step closer to its actualization."

 KAZ_reunification_struggle_desc: "During the absence of any significant socialist authority spanning the whole of Kazakhstan, various warlords, republics, and theocracies have sprung out of its lands, each staking their claims on it. During and immediately after the German terror bombing campaign, we have turned a blind eye to these. Pragmatism was the rule of the day; even if the administration could take on all of them, the remnants of the army would be too weak to hold it, lacking fuel, qualified personnel, and equipment.\n\nThese obstacles are now gone. The economy is roaring alive after the depression following the bombing, and the army stands ready to take the battle to these interlopers. It is now time to prepare and inspire the populace to take up the struggle of reunification, by speeches, radio programs, and songs. Soon socialism shall return to Kazakhstan, stronger than ever before."

Some of their officials are pathological anti-Communists, but many of the influential figures in Pavlodar expressed their desire to cooperate with our country and support our struggle against the more heinous reactionaries and bandits.\n\nEven though the interests of workers and bourgeoise are incompatible, it is possible that reconciling with Pavlodar on our specified conditions would be more fruitful in the long-term perspective than another military campaign, as long as the enlightened gentry is ready to acknowledge the Soviet democracy and our just struggle. Of course, we should not underestimate the price of such compromise."

Nevertheless, the Red Army faced far more threatening challenges in the past.

The Kazakh proletariat, which became free from the prejudices and superstitions of the past, will not follow the preachings of the parochial imams of Zabelkin.

Among them were the sons and daughters of Poland, who were forcibly resettled by Nazis in Western Kazakhstan. The Soviet government generously gave them shelter, but in the anarchy that followed, the Polish ASSR seceded from Soviet Kazakhstan.\n\nAs it stands, the "New Poland" does not recognize the Soviet power but neither it does seek to spread their reactionary customs and their government is mostly motivated by desire of their people to settle down in the new home.

Like its predecessor, it was weak, divided. Now history repeats itself. Its democracy, with its delusion of political parties and partisan division, has, under historical precedence, crumbled to socialism.\n\nHowever, the administration finds its grasp over its populace tenuous. To remedy this, our civic planners look toward reaching out to the remnants of the Social Democrats. By blending them to a socialist party structure and ensuring their subservience to us, we can exert some more political control over the territory.

Private companies pour this black gold unto barrels, before shipping them off to the highest bidder.\n\nPavlodar has come under socialism, at last, and the administration now possesses this valuable asset. To further the extraction of it, the economic planners have recommended for collectivization to cover these companies.

Although more honest in their robbery than the reviled capitalists and nobles, these rats have taken from the proletariat labor and lives.\n\nWe cannot allow this crime to hold. The high command has agreed to send troops to protect convoys and to implement patrol schedules along the roads. They will also dispatch scouts to note the hideouts of these pests.

Even with the Soviet power reestablished in the city and the countryside, the people of Kokshetau live without any feeling of confidence in their safety from bandit attacks.\n\nThe war on criminals in Kokshetau has not ended, but it took a different, subtler form.
